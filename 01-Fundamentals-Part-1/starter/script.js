// ASSIGNMENT:
// 1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some
// countries have multiple languages, but just choose one).
// 2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never
// change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
// 3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens.
